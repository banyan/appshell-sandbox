An attempt to verify following [statement](https://blog.usejournal.com/when-should-i-server-side-render-c2a383ff2d0f):

>Does your app require a sign-in to view most content (e.g. GMail)?
>If so, you donâ€™t need SSR. Build a static app shell that pops up the login page with as fast of Time-To-Interactive as you can, and preload all of your app's assets and scripts while the user types in their credentials. Use a service worker to cache your app shell so subsequent loads remain super-speedy.
